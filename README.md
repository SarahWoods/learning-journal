## Growth Mindset
**Growth Mindset is a way of approaching learning wherein mistakes are viewed as learning opportunities, criticism is viewed as a way to improve, and that there are no limits to your learning and success**

The following reminders are imperative to staying in a "Growth Mindset":

  -Reframe thinking - change the way you look at a difficult task as "I don't understand this yet" instead of "I don't get it"

  -Learn to embrace criticism - remember that criticism of your work provides you a way of improving

  -Celebrate the success of others - their success is not a reflection of you
